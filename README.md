# spring-boot-war

[Deploy a Spring Boot WAR into a Tomcat Server](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-war-tomcat-deploy)

We should consider that this new setup makes our Spring Boot application a non-standalone application (if you would like to have it working in standalone mode again, remove the *provided* scope from the tomcat dependency).
